Project Euler via C#
====================

Synopsis
--------

My exploration of the [Project Euler][1] problem space via [C#][2].

This is from 2012, and the (im)maturity of my C# skills and style, as well as
the architecture, demonstrate this. I'd like to think I've come a long way.

Running the Problems
--------------------

Open `ProjectEulerCS.sln` in Visual Studio. Change the problem (I know!) in
`Program.cs`, then run the solution.
